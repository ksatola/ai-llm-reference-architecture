# Vibe Coding
**Vibe coding** is the trend of building software by telling an AI (LLM) what you want in plain language and letting it write/run most or all of the code - judging results by whether it works rather than by reading the code yourself. 

The term was popularized by Andrej Karpathy in 2025 and has since been used for fast prototyping and "software-for-one" tools. Fans like it for speed and accessibility; critics warn it can hide bugs, create security issues, and shouldnâ€™t replace proper review, testing, and engineering rigor.

## Tips for successful vibing
- **Prompt well for good vibes** - ask (prompt) explicitely for short answers (concise, clean code) and latest APIs for today's date
- **Vibe but verify** - ask more than one LLM the same question
- **Step up the vibe** - break down your request into independently testable steps and tell LLM to work on each step separatelly (or ask LLM to split your problem into such steps without code and then ask LLM to write code for each of the steps separately)
- **Vibe and validate** - ask an LLM then get another LLM to check
- **Vibe with variety** - ask for more than one solution to the same problem and pick the best
- **Vibe with understanding** - ask LLM to explain clearly what the code does
