# AI/ML Project Feasibility Study
Before building an AI/ML solution can begin, there are a few questions that need to be answered regarding alignment with business priorities, data, resource/budget and skills availability, development and runtime costs, development time, and return on investment (ROI).

A feasibility study should be conducted to confirm whether the proposed idea, in comparison to other initiatives, makes sense to undertake.

## What
Define:
1. The business need or the problem to be solved, articulated in business terms.
2. MVP first iteration features in scope (both functional and non-functional requirements).

## Why
Understand the context of the initiative: opportunities, risks, challenges, obstacles, etc.:
1. Is the initiative aligned with business objectives? What are those objectives?
2. Do we have the capabilities and capacity to execute the initiative? If not, what needs to be addressed?
3. Are training and inference data available? If not, what would be the cost and time required to obtain them?
4. Is there a budget for this initiative? What is the expected timeline? What value does it bring, and what ROI is anticipated?
5. Are there any limitations or requirements regarding data and methods (e.g., legal/ethical, compliance, or solution explainability)?

## How
Define the execution paths (key steps):
1. Translating the problem from business to AI domain.
2. Ensuring alignment with enterprise architecture or existing solutions to maximise reusability, consistency, and compliance with the overall AI solution portfolio (build vs. buy vs. reuse), as well as with supporting systems (e.g., identity and access management).
3. Drafting the initial solution design.
4. Assessing data (origin, rights to use, bias/ethics, ownership).
5. Estimating the solution's cost.
