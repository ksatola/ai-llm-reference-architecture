# Tools
No matter which agentic system you're building, tools will likely be an important part of your agent. Tools enable LLMs to interact with external services and APIs by specifying their exact structure and definition in our API.

Tool definitions and specifications should be given just as much prompt engineering attention as your overall prompts.

## Prompt engineering your tools
There are often several ways to specify the same action. For instance, you can specify a file edit by writing a diff, or by rewriting the entire file. For structured output, you can return code inside markdown or inside JSON. In software engineering, differences like these are cosmetic and can be converted losslessly from one to the other. However, some formats are much more difficult for an LLM to write than others. Writing a diff requires knowing how many lines are changing in the chunk header before the new code is written. Writing code inside JSON (compared to markdown) requires extra escaping of newlines and quotes.

Here are suggestions for deciding on tool formats are the following:
- Give the model enough tokens to "think" before it writes itself into a corner.
- Keep the format close to what the model has seen naturally occurring in text on the internet.
- Make sure there's no formatting "overhead" such as having to keep an accurate count of thousands of lines of code, or string-escaping any code it writes.

One rule of thumb is to think about how much effort goes into Human-Computer Interfaces (HCI), and plan to invest just as much effort in creating good Agent-Computer Interfaces (ACI). Here are some thoughts on how to do so:
- Put yourself in the model's shoes. Is it obvious how to use this tool, based on the description and parameters, or would you need to think carefully about it? If so, then it’s probably also true for the model. A good tool definition often includes example usage, edge cases, input format requirements, and clear boundaries from other tools.
- How can you change parameter names or descriptions to make things more obvious? Think of this as writing a great docstring for a junior developer on your team. This is especially important when using many similar tools.
- Test how the model uses your tools. Run many example inputs to see what mistakes the model makes, and iterate.
